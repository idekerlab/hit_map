CI/CD
==========================================================

A ``.travis.yml`` file is included in this
repo to easily enable continous integration / continuous development
via `Travis <https://travis-ci.com>`__

The configuration leverages `coverage <https://pypi.org/project/coverage/>`__
and `coveralls <https://coveralls.io>`__ to log
code coverage
